      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I received Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Electronic Engineering at Hanyang University in 2025. During my doctoral studies, my research primarily focused on two critical building blocks in modern communication systems: the low-noise amplifier (LNA) and the phase-locked loop (PLL). My work addressed persistent challenges in advanced RFIC design, with a particular emphasis on reducing power consumption and enhancing key performance metrics such as linearity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the Ph.D., I emphasized not only theoretical innovation but also practical validation. My works have been published in leading journals, including the <em>IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits (JSSC)</em> and <em>IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques (TMTT)</em>. All proposed designs were validated through silicon tapeout, enabling direct evaluation in fabricated chip systems and demonstrating their practical effectiveness. This end-to-end methodology from architectural conception to silicon measurement has ensured my contributions extended beyond simulation and theory to deliver tangible advances in integrated circuit technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Beyond-G Innovation Research Center at Hanyang University, where I continue to advance my academic career. In this role, I apply my RFIC design expertise to the development of 6G wireless systems, with a particular focus on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). My research aims to bridge fundamental circuit-level innovations with emerging system-level demands, including real-time responsiveness, ultra-low latency, and seamless integration of communication and sensing functions.
