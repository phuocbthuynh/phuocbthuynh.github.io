      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I received my Ph.D. in Electronic Engineering from Hanyang University in 2025. During my doctoral studies, my research primarily focused on two critical building blocks in modern communication systems: the low-noise amplifier (LNA) and the phase-frequency detector (PFD) of the phase-locked loop (PLL). I worked extensively on reducing power consumption while maintaining or improving performance, and on enhancing linearity, both of which are persistent challenges in advanced RFIC design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my Ph.D., I emphasized not only theoretical innovation but also practical validation. My works have been published in leading journals, including the <em>IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits (JSSC)</em> and <em>IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques (TMTT)</em>. Each of these projects underwent silicon tapeout, which allowed me to evaluate the designs in real chip systems and demonstrate their effectiveness in practice. This end-to-end approach, from concept to tapeout, ensured that my contributions were not limited to simulations or theory but had tangible impact on integrated circuit technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently continuing my academic career as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Beyond-G Innovation Research Center (IRC) at Hanyang University. In this role, I am applying my expertise in RFIC design to the development of 6G wireless systems, with a particular focus on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). I aim to advance the frontier of communication technology by bridging fundamental circuit-level innovations with emerging system-level requirements such as real-time responsiveness, ultra-low latency, and seamless integration of communication and sensing.
