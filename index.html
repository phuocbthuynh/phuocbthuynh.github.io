      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I received my Ph.D. in Electronic Engineering from Hanyang University in 2025. During my doctoral studies, my research primarily focused on two critical building blocks in modern communication systems: the low-noise amplifier (LNA) and the phase-frequency detector (PFD) of the phase-locked loop (PLL). I worked extensively on reducing power consumption while maintaining or improving performance, and on enhancing linearity, both of which are persistent challenges in advanced RFIC design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my Ph.D., I emphasized not only theoretical innovation but also practical validation. My works have been published in leading journals, including the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits (JSSC) and IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques (TMTT). Each of these projects underwent silicon tapeout, which allowed me to evaluate the designs in real chip systems and demonstrate their effectiveness in practice. This end-to-end approach, from concept to tapeout, ensured that my contributions were not limited to simulations or theory but had tangible impact on integrated circuit technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to my Ph.D. at Hanyang University, I earned an Engineering degree in Electronics Engineering, which is equivalent to a master’s degree. This foundation equipped me with the essential background in circuits, devices, and communication systems, enabling me to pursue more advanced research questions during my doctoral work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently continuing my academic career as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Beyond 6G Innovation Research Center (IRC) at Hanyang University. In this role, I am applying my expertise in RFIC design to the development of sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems, with a particular focus on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). I aim to advance the frontier of communication technology by bridging fundamental circuit-level innovations with emerging system-level requirements such as real-time responsiveness, ultra-low latency, and seamless integration of communication and sensing.
