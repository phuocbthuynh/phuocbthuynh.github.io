      <h1>Mentoring</h1>

      <p>
        From time to time, students reach out with concerns about integrated circuit (IC) design such as
        how to start, whether graduate school makes sense, or what are
        career paths in analog and RFIC.
      </p>

      <p>
        In many cases, the difficulty is not the lack of effort, but the absence of
        a place to talk through direction, expectations, and tradeoffs, which
        is not always resolved by reading more material. Those often lead beyond technical details to broader
        decisions about research and career direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this reason, I am open to mentoring conversations that start informally as a short
        discussion to help clarify learning direction, academic choices, or possible next steps. This mentoring program includes
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Research direction</strong>: paper reading strategy, topic selection, and framing contributions</li>
        <li><strong>Graduate study</strong>: school/lab matching, SOP/CV feedback and interview prep</li>
        <li><strong>Career planning</strong>: portfolio review, internship strategies</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Mentoring works in <strong>1:1 online session + async feedback</strong></p>

      <p>
        Students from Vietnam are especially welcome.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you feel that a conversation could help clarify your direction,
    you are welcome to reach out by email:<br/>
        <a href="mailto:phuochuynh@hanyang.ac.kr">phuochuynh@hanyang.ac.kr</a>
      </p>

      <p><em><strong>
        Sometimes, a short conversation save months of uncertainty.
      </em></strong></p>
